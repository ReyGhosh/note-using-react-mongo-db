# 3.10.0

* cssnano will no longer `console.warn` any messages when using deprecated
  options; these are now sent to PostCSS. You will be able to see them if you
  use a PostCSS runner with built-in messages support, or alternately by
  loading `postcss-reporter` or `postcss-browser-reporter` in your plugins list.
* Prepares support for `grid` identifier reduction by adding it to the list
  of optimisations turned off when `options.safe` is set to `true`.
* Adds support for normalizing `unicode-range` descriptors. Values will
  be converted when the code matches `0` & `f` in the same place on both sides
  of the range. So, `u+2000-2fff` can be converted to `u+2???`, but
  `u+2100-2fff` will be left as it is.

# 3.9.1

* Resolves an integration issue with `v3.9.0`, where `undefined` values
  would attempt to be parsed.

# 3.9.0

* Adds a new option to normalize wrapping quotes for strings & joining
  multiple-line strings into a single line. This optimisation can potentially
  reduce the final gzipped size of your CSS file.

# 3.8.2

* Resolves an issue where `display: list-item inline flow` would be normalized
  to `inline list-item` rather than `inline-list-item` (thanks to @mattbasta).

# 3.8.1

* Adds a quick start file for easy integration with Runkit. Try cssnano online
  at https://runkit.com/npm/cssnano.

# 3.8.0

* Adds support for normalizing multiple values for the `display` property. For
  example `block flow` can be simplified to `block`.

# 3.7.7

* Further improves CSS mixin handling; semicolons will no longer be stripped
  from *rules* as well as declarations.

# 3.7.6

* Resolves an issue where the semicolon was being incorrectly stripped
  from CSS mixins.

# 3.7.5

* Resolves an issue where the `safe` flag was not being persisted across
  multiple files (thanks to @techmatt101).

# 3.7.4

* Improves performance of the reducePositions transform by testing
  against `hasOwnProperty` instead of using an array of object keys.
* Removes the redundant `indexes-of` dependency.

# 3.7.3

* Unpins postcss-filter-plugins from `2.0.0` as a fix has landed in the new
  version of uniqid.

# 3.7.2

* Temporarily pins postcss-filter-plugins to version `2.0.0` in order to
  mitigate an issue with uniqid `3.0.0`.

# 3.7.1

* Enabling safe mode now turns off both postcss-merge-idents &
  postcss-normalize-url's `stripWWW` option.

# 3.7.0

* Added: Reduce `background-repeat` definitions; works with both this property
  & the `background` shorthand, and aims to compress the extended two value
  syntax into the single value syntax.
* Added: Reduce `initial` values for properties when the *actual* initial value
  is shorter; for example, `min-width: initial` becomes `min-width: 0`.

# 3.6.2

* Fixed an issue where cssnano would crash on `steps(1)`.

# 3.6.1

* Fixed an issue where cssnano would crash on `steps` functions with a
  single argument.

# 3.6.0

* Added `postcss-discard-overridden` to safely discard overridden rules with
  the same identifier (thanks to @Justineo).
* Added: Reduce animation/transition timing functions. Detects `cubic-bezier`
  functions that are equivalent to the timing keywords and compresses, as well
  as normalizing the `steps` timing function.
* Added the `perspective-origin` property to the list of supported properties
  transformed by the `reduce-positions` transform.

# 3.5.2

* Resolves an issue where the 3 or 4 value syntax for `background-position`
  were being incorrectly converted.

# 3.5.1

* Improves checking for `background-position` values in the `background`
  shorthand property.

# 3.5.0

* Adds a new optimisation path which can minimise keyword values for
  `background-position` and the `background` shorthand.
* Tweaks to performance in the `core` module, now performs less AST passes.
* Now compiled with Babel 6.

# 3.4.0

* Adds a new optimisation path which can minimise gradient parameters
  automatically.

# 3.3.2

* Fixes an issue where using `options.safe` threw an error when cssnano was
  not used as part of a PostCSS instance, but standalone (such as in modules
  like gulp-cssnano). cssnano now renames `safe` internally to `isSafe`.

# 3.3.1

* Unpins postcss-colormin from `2.1.2`, as the `2.1.3` & `2.1.4` patches had
  optimization regressions that are now resolved in `2.1.5`.

# 3.3.0

* Updated modules to use postcss-value-parser version 3 (thanks to @TrySound).
* Now converts between transform functions with postcss-reduce-transforms.
  e.g. `translate3d(0, 0, 0)` becomes `translateZ(0)`.

# 3.2.0

* cssnano no longer converts `outline: none` to `outline: 0`, as there are
  some cases where the values are not equivalent (thanks to @TrySound).
* cssnano no longer converts for example `16px` to `1pc` *by default*. Length
  optimisations can be turned on via `{convertValues: {length: true}}`.
* Improved minimization of css functions (thanks to @TrySound).

# 3.1.0

* This release swaps postcss-single-charset for postcss-normalize-charset,
  which can detect encoding to determine whether a charset is necessary.
  Optionally, you can set the `add` option to `true` to prepend a UTF-8
  charset to the output automatically (thanks to @TrySound).
* A `safe` option was added, which disables
